# Differential-Drive-Mobile-Robot-Hardware-Modelling-URDF

Designed a differential-drive mobile robot in Fusion 360 including chassis, wheels, motors, and sensor mounts
• Converted the mechanical model into a ROS2-compatible URDF/Xacro with correct link–joint structure
• Defined the complete TF tree (base footprint, base link, wheels, sensors) for navigation and localization
• Configured wheel revolute joints, collision/visual meshes, and validated rendering in RViz2 and Gazebo
